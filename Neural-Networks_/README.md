# Neural-Networks_1

# Convolutional Neural Networks: Application

Welcome to Course 4's second assignment! In this notebook, you will:

- Create a mood classifer using the TF Keras Sequential API
- Build a ConvNet to identify sign language digits using the TF Keras Functional API

**After this assignment you will be able to:**

- Build and train a ConvNet in TensorFlow for a __binary__ classification problem
- Build and train a ConvNet in TensorFlow for a __multiclass__ classification problem
- Explain different use cases for the Sequential and Functional APIs

To complete this assignment, you should already be familiar with TensorFlow. If you are not, please refer back to the **TensorFlow Tutorial** of the third week of Course 2 ("**Improving deep neural networks**").

## Important Note on Submission to the AutoGrader

Before submitting your assignment to the AutoGrader, please make sure you are not doing the following:

1. You have not added any _extra_ `print` statement(s) in the assignment.
2. You have not added any _extra_ code cell(s) in the assignment.
3. You have not changed any of the function parameters.
4. You are not using any global variables inside your graded exercises. Unless specifically instructed to do so, please refrain from it and use the local variables instead.
5. You are not changing the assignment code where it is not required, like creating _extra_ variables.

If you do any of the following, you will get something like, `Grader not found` (or similarly unexpected) error upon submitting your assignment. Before asking for help/debugging the errors in your assignment, check for these first. If this is the case, and you don't remember the changes you have made, you can get a fresh copy of the assignment by following these [instructions](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks/supplement/DS4yP/h-ow-to-refresh-your-workspace).
